# Dark Pattern Detection

## Description

This project focuses on identifying and analyzing deceptive design practices—commonly known as dark patterns—in e-commerce websites. It automatically scans web pages, detects patterns such as hidden costs, false urgency, forced action, and misdirection, and flags them for review. By combining web scraping, pattern recognition, and rule-based detection, the tool aims to promote transparency, improve user awareness, and support ethical design standards in online shopping platforms.
